        Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks 
      </h3>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">DBS checks are criminal record checks. If you’re applying for a job, university, college or insurance, you may be told a DBS check is needed. You should also be told what type of check will be done.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Criminal record checks are usually done through the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Some spent cautions and convictions are ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-filtering-guidance">protected</a>’ and will not show on a DBS certificate.</p>

      <p>Criminal record checks are usually done through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)</a>. The 4 types of DBS checks are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Basic - shows only cautions and convictions that are not spent.</li>
        <li>Standard - shows all convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings, even if they’re spent</li>
        <li>Enhanced - shows the same information as a standard check but also includes any information held by the police that they think is relevant to your application.</li>
        <li>Enhanced with barred list - shows the same information as an enhanced check but also tells employers if you’ve been barred from doing the role you’re applying for</li>
      </ul>
